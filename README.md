## Game Name: Wordle
### *Description*
Wordle is a browser game that allows each user six guesses to guess the correct word automatically generated by the computer. 


### *Why did I choose this game?*
I chose Wordle because many of my friends and family already enjoy this game. I wanted to build a game that would interest the people in my life testing the game for me.

### *Getting Started*
[Play the Game](https://tpiol.github.io/wordle/)

> ***How to Play***
* Each player will be given six tries to guess the correct word.
* If a word is not in the Wordle dictionary, it will say "this is not a valid word".
* If you guess a word inside the Wordle dictionary, it will then show you: <br>
         ![Green Rectangle](./assets/U.png) : green means the letter is in the correct spot. <br>
        ![Yellow Rectangle](./assets/E.png) : yellow means a correct letter is in the wrong spot. <br>
        ![Coral Rectangle](./assets/Q.png) : coral means the letter is not in the word.<br>
